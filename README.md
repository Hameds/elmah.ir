# elmah.ir

[elmah.ir](http://elmah.ir) is my personal weblog built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) (A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in [Go](https://golang.org/)). 

### Run source code locally
The source code is in [master branch](https://github.com/Hameds/elmah.ir/tree/master), after installing [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) you need to clone this repo

`$ git clone https://github.com/Hameds/elmah.ir.git`

then go to elmah.ir folder and run Hugo's built-in local server

`$ hugo server`

now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

### Html Version
if you don't want to run site from source code and just want to see html version of this site, you can [download gh-pages branch](https://github.com/Hameds/elmah.ir/archive/gh-pages.zip)
